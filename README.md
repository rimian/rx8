# RX8

This is for repurposing the RX8 satelite navigation to run engine parameters on a Raspberry PI.

## What you need to do

You'll need the following equipment:

* An OBDII bluebooth adapter
* A Raspberry PI
* A 7 inch screen.

## Booting up in Kiosk Mode

The easiest example I found so far: https://core-electronics.com.au/guides/raspberry-pi-kiosk-mode-setup/#V1Y5SSB using Wayland config.
