# RX8

This is for repurposing the RX8 satelite navigation to run engine parameters on a Raspberry PI.

## What you need to do

You'll need the following equipment:

* An OBDII bluebooth adapter
* A Raspberry PI
* A 7 inch screen.

## Pulling things apart

In my case, my RX8 did not have a satelite navigation system installed so, I bought an entire using off eBay. I recommend using a second hand screen and swapping it out later. There's a lot of stuff to pull apart and it will take you a long time. If you have a spare, you can work on it and then swap it out of your car later. If not, go right ahead and pull out your centre console. 

Here's some instructions I found on doing that: https://newscrewdriver.com/2023/08/06/removing-navigation-lcd-assembly-from-2004-mazda-rx-8/

## Booting up in Kiosk Mode

The easiest example I found so far: https://core-electronics.com.au/guides/raspberry-pi-kiosk-mode-setup/#V1Y5SSB using Wayland config.
